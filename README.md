## Code and technical details

The folder ModelCode contains the basic code to reproduce all simulations that produced the results presented in the paper.
Simulation scripts are written in python/2.7 and generate xml and nml files that can be used to run simulations in NEURON/7.4 via the pyNeuroML-interface in NeuroML/v2beta4 (https://www.neuroml.org/neuromlv2).
Versions:
ModelCode/NeuronModels contains the nml-files for cell morphologies and biophysical parameters. These can be generated with the code contained in ModelCode/MakeNeuronModel.
